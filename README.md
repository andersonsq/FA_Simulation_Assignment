## Disclaimer

Due to some difficuties in apllying the concept of pick and place, this part of the assigment was not implemented.
Instead, it was used in the scene the `traditional path planning`, this way the professor could see the robot moving on the scene and the IK in action.

To see a more complete steps of what was done in this Flexible Automation Assigment, please change to the *master* branch
